This is a simple filter that uses KiokuDB as an object request broker
thingamabob.

Any list of objects can be a message. Objects which are registered in the
database are passed by reference, and other objects are serialized directly
into the message string.

This code will change when KiokuDB gets support for nonblocking usage,
otherwise in an event driven API the `decode` method might block.
